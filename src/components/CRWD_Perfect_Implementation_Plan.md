### Session-Based Check-in System
**Revolutionary approach that eliminates battery drainage while ensuring accuracy:**

1. **Smart Session Management**: Track presence through app usage patterns
2. **Single GPS Validation**: One location check per check-in
3. **Activity-Based Tracking**: Monitor app interactions instead of location
4. **Intelligent Expiry**: Context-aware session timeouts with automatic cleanup
5. **Manual Overrides**: User-controlled session management
6. **üîí Security Features**:
   - Fraud detection for rapid check-in cycles
   - GPS spoofing detection
   - Multiple device conflict resolution
   - Location-based auto-checkout
7. **‚ö° Performance Optimizations**:
   - Discount locking mechanism (5-minute window)
   - Race condition handling for real-time updates
   - Proper session state machine transitions
8. **üîó Simple Referral Features**:
   - Phone-verified referral system (fraud prevention)
   - "Bring a Friend Tonight" passes (24-hour token access)
   - Milestone rewards (7 days free at 3, 1 month free at 10)
   - Clean sharing via SMS/QR codes
   - No social features or friend lists

## üá∑üá¥ Romanian Market Strategy

### Payment Integration (Post-MVP)
- **Provider**: PayU Romania (market leader)
- **Currency**: RON (Romanian Leu)
- **Plans**: 7-day (10 LEI), 30-day (30 LEI)
- **Integration Timeline**: Pre-launch (Week 17-18)

### Referral Economics
- **Friend Pass Cost**: 0 LEI to CRWD (bars absorb discount cost)
- **7 Days Free Cost**: 10 LEI per reward
- **1 Month Free Cost**: 30 LEI per reward
- **ROI**: 400%+ return (10 referrals = 300+ LEI LTV vs 60 LEI cost)

### Localization
- **Language**: Romanian primary, English secondary
- **Phone System**: Romanian mobile numbers (+40) with SMS verification
- **Business Registration**: CUI validation for Romanian businesses
- **Legal Compliance**: GDPR, Romanian data protection laws
- **Cultural Fit**: Word-of-mouth referrals align with Romanian social culture

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Supabase Limits**: Monitor usage, plan scaling
- **Real-time Performance**: Implement connection pooling
- **Mobile Performance**: Regular profiling and optimization
- **üö® Session Management**: Implement proper expiry and cleanup mechanisms
- **üö® Discount Integrity**: Prevent race conditions and ensure accurate calculations
- **üö® Fraud Prevention**: Comprehensive detection to maintain platform trust

### Business Risks
- **Market Validation**: MVP approach reduces investment risk
- **Competition**: Focus on unique value proposition (dynamic discounts)
- **Regulatory**: Early legal consultation for Romanian compliance
- **üö® Discount Abuse**: Prevent manipulation of crowd-based discounts
- **üö® Platform Trust**: Ensure accurate crowd counts and fair discount distribution
- **üîó Referral Abuse**: Phone verification prevents fake account creation
- **üéÅ Friend Pass Economics**: 24-hour limit prevents abuse, bars benefit from exposure
